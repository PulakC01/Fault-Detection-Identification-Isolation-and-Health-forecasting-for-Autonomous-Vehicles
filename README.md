# Fault-Detection-Identification-Isolation-and-Health-forecasting-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
The main focus of research on autonomous driving is to improve driving accuracy and reliability. Despite significant progress, modern algorithms still fail occasionally, and some of those failures are due to sensor errors. Such failures can have fatal consequences. That's why it's important for self-driving cars to anticipate problems as early as possible. Machine learning techniques can be used to train data models by using real-world data and artificially injecting different types of sensor errors into healthy signals. This project proposes a new fault detection, isolation, identification, and prediction (detection-based) architecture for multiple faults in multi-sensor systems such as autonomous vehicles. Our detection, identification, and isolation platform uses two different efficient deep neural network architectures to deliver exceptional performance. The output of the sensor error detection system is then used to introduce health index measurements and use them to train a health index prediction network
